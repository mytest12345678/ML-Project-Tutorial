## ML-Project-Tutorial: ML_Project_POC_Tutorial.ipynb
A simple documented example of how to create an ML Project Workflow and how to manage a team to develop it over time. 

### ML Work Flow
1. ML Project Scoping
  - Identify and Document the Scope of the Project's Problem Space and it's qualities
  - Identify and Document the Scope of the Project's Solution Space and it's qualities
2. Project Env Prep
  - Install and Import libs
  - Remove or Archive any previous Training Session's Files before each New Training Session
3. Downloading/Querrying and Loading Data
4. Data Exploration 
  - Aggregate Stat Summarries
  - Visualizations
  - Update Project Scope
5. Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - Preprocessing Settings Selection
  - Model and Model Settings Selection
  - Training Settings Selection
  - Monitoring and Visualizations
7. Data drift and A/B Testing for QA
8. Model Serving and Monitoring

### Initial Project Repo Setup and Development Steps:
1. Hard code a bare-bones proof-of-concept (POC) for an ML Project, within the identified project scope, in a single jupyter notebook file.
2. Go back and Define functions for repeatable lines of code and define variables for controling previously hardcoded settings while improving naming conventions
3. Move functions into a seperate file and import them into the main file to make it simpler.
4. Add Documentation
5. Add more Features documented in the repo's issues and tracked in the project. 

### Project Management Steps:
1. Setup a Project Dashboard for the github repo.
2. Add meaningful views to the dashboard to help orginize the project.
3. Setup auto email alerts for team members assigned to issues when updates are posted.
4. Add issues and set the priority, size, sprint, labels, tags, and more if needed.
5. Set and enforce standards for team members posting to the project dashboard.
6. Set Rules for the repo to protect the main branch from updates without reviews from more than one person
7. Manually assign project issues for team members to work on or allow self assigning issues for a more hands free approach to managing the team.
8. Regularly sceduled meetings with your team and with other managers from other departments.
9. Allways encourage team members to ask questions for clarity on the goal of a tasks and encourage them to ask for more directions if they get stuck.
