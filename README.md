# Tutorial Guide:
These tutorials were made to showcase select skills.

## ML-Project-Tutorial: ML_Project_POC_Tutorial.ipynb
A simple documented example of how to create an ML Repo by writing a bare-bones proof-of-concept (POC), within the identified project scope, in a single jupyter notebook file.
### ML Work Flow
1. ML Project Scoping
    - Identify and Document the Scope of the Project's Problem Space and it's qualities
    - Identify and Document the Scope of the Project's Solution Space and it's qualities
2. Project Env Prep
    - Install and Import libs (needs more work)
    - Remove or Archive any previous Training Session's Files before each New Training Session
3. Downloading/Querrying and Loading Data
4. Data Exploration 
    - Aggregate Stat Summarries
    - Visualizations
    - Update Project Scope
5. Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Preprocessing Settings Selection
    - Model and Model Settings Selection
    - Training Settings Selection
    - Monitoring and Visualizations
7. Data drift and A/B Testing for QA (will be added later)
8. Model Serving and Production Monitoring (will be added later)
    - MLOps
    - CICD
    - visualizations

### Project Management: 
1. Setting up a Git Hub Project Dashboard and Repo.
    - Set Rules for the repo to protect the main branch by requiring reviews for push requests and prevent direct commits
    - Document Standards and naming conventions for repo branching if not yet established 
    - Add properties to attatch to issues such as priority, size, sprint, labels, tags, etc.
    - Add meaningful views to the dashboard to help orginize the project's issues by their properties.
    - Document standards for issue assignments and team members posting to the project dashboard in the description.
2. Attend regularly scheduled meetings with your team, other departments and other teams.
    - Write or update issue descriptions on new features and bugs.
    - Update the priorities, scheduled sprint, and other properties of issues.
    - Sumarize progress and other updates.
    - Highlight examples of good work contributed by team or individual team members.
3. Allways encourage team members to ask questions for clarity on the goal of a tasks and encourage them to ask for more directions if they get stuck.
    - Identify how they view the problem, how they are trying to sove it and how they arrived at these conclusions.
    - Identify what's the problem with this approach for solving the task
    - Identify a proper approach to solving the task
    - Identify what steps they could taken to better understand the problem and eventually come up with a similar viable solution to the problem by seaking out the aswers to a set of well framed questions online.
    - Then, using all that information, ask questions to lead them towards the answer without just giving them the solution.
    - Time spent mentoring juniors is an investment into their potential and never a waste of time if done properly.
### Development Steps for a project with AGILE Sprints:
1. Select an issue in the project to work on from the current Sprint and a assign it to yourself to get email updates.
2. Add or debug the documented feature in the issues with commits to a seperate branch.
3. Make a pull request for the seperate branch and link it to the issue.
4. move the issue to "In Review" and unassign yourself from the task
